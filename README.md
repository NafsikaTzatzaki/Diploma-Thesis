The aim of this work is to present and implement algorithms for identifying problems and finding maximum clique problems related to diamond-free graphs. 
A graph is diamond-free if it does not contain a diamond as an induced subgraph. The application concerns simple, coherent, and undirected graphs. 
The core process is an algorithm that checks whether a particular node of the graph is part of an induced C4 or diamond using the search algorithm Î’readth-First Search. 
This process is part of a C4 or diamond induced subgraph recognition algorithm on the whole graph.A graph is (C4, diamond)-free if it contains neither C4 nor diamond 
as an induced subgraph. Finding a maximum clique in a (house, diamond)-free graph is also a problem and object of the work.The process of locating and enumerating 
all cliques, including the maximum cliques, helps to find the largest clique in a graph. Maximum clique is a clique with the maximum possible number of nodes. 
Additionally, for the recognition problem, another alternative approach to recognizing graph diamonds is presented.The algorithms are implemented using the Python 
programming language. Finally, with the use of the Python libraries NetworkX and Matplotlib we render visually and comprehensibly the steps of each algorithm to examine 
their correct implementation.
